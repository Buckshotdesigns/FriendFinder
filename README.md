# FriendFinder

The friend finder app is an interactive application that returns cartoon characters as cartoon side kicks.

The user is prompted with a page to start the survey and it takes you to the survey page.

You must enter a name and a url for your profile picture.

You then answer 10 questions. Each question is on a scale of 1-5, 1 being least likely to identify with the 
question, and 5 being most likely.

Answers are recorded and tried against the list of potential cartoon sidekicks and it returns a pop up 
with the best match.

The application uses node, express, html and javascript. It is also deployed to heroku to run.
