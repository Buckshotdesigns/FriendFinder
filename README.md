### Description
The friend finder app is an interactive application that returns cartoon characters as cartoon side kicks.

### Functionality
- The user is prompted with a page to start the survey and it takes you to the survey page.
- You must enter a name and a url for your profile picture.
- You then answer 10 questions. Each question is on a scale of 1-5, 1 being least likely to identify with the 
question, and 5 being most likely.
- Answers are recorded and tried against the list of potential cartoon sidekicks and it returns a pop up 
with the best match.
